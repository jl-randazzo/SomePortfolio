----README FOR DAILYPLANNINGVIEWOBJBUILDERTEST----

As part of the MVC website I was working on with my team, we had to write
NUnit tests for many already established classes. I picked this one in
particular because I wrote many of the lines and it nicely demonstrates my
knowledge of the Moq and NUnit frameworks. I did not use all of my NUnit
skills (such as theory testing) because the job we were working on didn't call
for it. 

This is technically not TDD given the fact that these tests were written after
the View Objects had already been coded, but in the process of writing them,
we did manage to unearth and fix a few bugs. 

View DMPCWMTHelperTest.cs to see an example of code that was written in a TDD
development framework.
