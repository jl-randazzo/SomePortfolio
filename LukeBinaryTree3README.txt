-----LukeBinaryTree3 README-----

This is the obligitory data structure demonstration. Obviously, I know in any
practical circumstance it doesn't make sense to build this stuff manually, but
it is a good way to become more familiar with the ideas and some of the
difficult underlying coding problems. 

I wrote this for school, and it is my own implementation of a self-sorting
binary search tree. I have done tests with it, and it functions appropriately.
I wrote this class quite some time ago, so many things in here reflect
practices I would no longer do. It is not extremely legible, partially because
I was trying to do my own implementation and avoiding the common abstractions
used for self-sorting trees such as red and black nodes. 

In any case, I hope it proves that I know my way around Java. I'd certainly
say I'm stronger in C#, but they are incredibly similar. I began my process of
learning in Java and eventually switched over to the C family of languages.
