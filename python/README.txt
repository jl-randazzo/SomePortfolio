------ Python ------

I have experience writing some visual applications in Python. I'd definitely
admit it's not the language I've spent the most time with; however, I know how
it works syntactically and am more than competent enough in it to solve real
problems quickly. I had a few dozens documents like the in.txt document you
see above that I needed to collect the csv of the email address and full name
from clients for my job, and I whipped up a quick Python script to take care
of the job for me. I want to learn much more about it, but this is currently
my level of competency.

What I like about Python is how quickly you can achieve simple tasks. I'm much
more familiar with C++, C#, and Java, but typing up a quick, lightweight
solution to a problem is always so fast in Python. Parser.py took me eight
minutes to write and saved me hours of work.
